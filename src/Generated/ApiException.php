/**
 * Corbado API
 *
 * # Introduction The Corbado API is documented in **OpenAPI format** and provides an overview of all Corbado API calls to implement passwordless authentication with Passkeys (Biometrics).  # Authentication To authenticate your API requests HTTP Basic Auth is used.  You need to set the projectID as username and the API secret as password. The authorization header look as follows:  `Basic <<projectID>:<API secret>>`  The **authorization header** needs to be **Base64 encrypted** to be working. If the authorization header is missing or incorrect, the API will respond with 401.  ## basicAuth **Security Scheme Type:** HTTP  **HTTP Authorization Scheme:** `basic`   ## projectID **Security Scheme Type:** API Key  **Header parameter name:** `x-Corbado-ProjectID`  # Security and privacy Corbado services are designed, developed, monitored, and updated with security at our core to protect you and your customers’ data and privacy.  ## Security  ### Infrastructure security Corbado leverages highly available and secure cloud infrastructure to ensure that our services are always available and securely delivered. Corbado's services are operated in uvensyse GmbH's data centers in Germany and comply with ISO standard 27001. All data centers have redundant power and internet connections to avoid failure. The main location of the servers used is in Linden and offers 24/7 support. We do not use any AWS, GCP or Azure services.  Each server is monitored 24/7 and in the event of problems, automated information is sent via SMS and e-mail. The monitoring is done by the external service provider Serverguard24 GmbH.   All Corbado hardware and networking is routinely updated and audited to ensure systems are secure and that least privileged access is followed. Additionally we implement robust logging and audit protocols that allow us high visibility into system use.  ### Responsible disclosure program Here at Corbado, we take the security of our user’s data and of our services seriously. As such, we encourage responsible security research on Corbado services and products. If you believe you’ve discovered a potential vulnerability, please let us know by emailing us at [security@corbado.com](mailto:security@corbado.com). We will acknowledge your email within 2 business days. As public disclosures of a security vulnerability could put the entire Corbado community at risk, we ask that you keep such potential vulnerabilities confidential until we are able to address them. We aim to resolve critical issues within 30 days of disclosure. Please make a good faith effort to avoid violating privacy, destroying data, or interrupting or degrading the Corbado service. Please only interact with accounts you own or for which you have explicit permission from the account holder. While researching, please refrain from:  - Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) - Spamming - Social engineering or phishing of Corbado employees or contractors - Any attacks against Corbado's physical property or data centers  Thank you for helping to keep Corbado and our users safe!  ### Rate limiting At Corbado, we apply rate limit policies on our APIs in order to protect your application and user management infrastructure, so your users will have a frictionless non-interrupted experience.  Corbado responds with HTTP status code 429 (too many requests) when the rate limits exceed. Your code logic should be able to handle such cases by checking the status code on the response and recovering from such cases. If a retry is needed, it is best to allow for a back-off to avoid going into an infinite retry loop.  The current rate limit for all our API endpoints is **max. 100 requests per 10 seconds**.  ## Privacy Corbado is committed to protecting the personal data of our customers and their customers. Corbado has in place appropriate data security measures that meet industry standards. We regularly review and make enhancements to our processes, products, documentation, and contracts to help support ours and our customers’ compliance for the processing of personal data.  We try to minimize the usage and processing of personally identifiable information. Therefore, all our services are constructed to avoid unnecessary data consumption.  To make our services work, we only require the following data: - any kind of identifier (e.g. UUID, phone number, email address) - IP address (only temporarily for rate limiting aspects) - User agent (for device management)
